Rosie (chatbot base)
====================

Rosie is a collection of AIML and AIML 2.0 files that form a solid base for any chatbot project. Rosie is a fork of the ALICE 2.0 project that has been optimized for use on the Pandorabots platform. 

To try out Rosie, create an account and a new bot on the [Playground](https://playground.pandorabots.com), and upload the files found under the lib directory. 

To begin customizing Rosie, try changing some of the values found in rosie.properties.

For a more detailed description of Rosie's contents, please read the [introductory blog post](http://blog.pandorabots.com/2014/09/rosie-brand-new-base-content.html) on the topic.
